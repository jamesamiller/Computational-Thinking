In the notebook `timeStepping`, we looked at a finite difference equation
```math
x(t+\Delta t) = x(t) + f(x(t),t) \Delta t,
```
where the "increment" function ``f`` could in turn depend on ``x(t)`` and ``t``.

This equation is a recipe for updating ``x`` in time, but we saw that the recipe is not exact. Specifically, if ``f`` does depend on ``x`` and/or ``t``, then *where* we evaluate ``f`` in the time interval ``\Delta t`` mattered. We could get different results for different choices.

However, the issue of *where* to evaluate ``f`` goes away if the interval becomes infinitesimally small; i.e., ``\Delta t \rightarrow 0``. Let's rewrite the finite difference equation as
```math
\frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t} = f(x(t),t) .
```
Letting ``\Delta t \rightarrow 0`` is denoted by
```math
\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t} = f(x(t),t) .
```
Now, this looks suspicious. Are we dividing by zero? No, ``\Delta t`` never becomes zero; it just gets arbitrarily close.

The quantity on the left of this equation is called a **derivative**. It's definition *is* the left side of the equation. Unless ``x`` is some pathological function, this quantity exists. It's study is covered in calculus.

And so the "derivative of ``x`` with respect to ``t``" is defined by
```math
\frac{dx}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t}
```

### Calculation

md"""
If we know the *analytic expression* (i.e., can write down the exact function) for ``x(t)`` then we can find the derivative according to the definition.

For example, suppse we want to find the derivative of ``x(t) = t^2``. Then, Step 1:
```math
\begin{align}
x(t+\Delta t) &= (t + \Delta t)^2 \\
&= t^2 + 2 t \Delta t + (\Delta t)^2
\end{align}
```
Since we are going to let $\Delta t$ become as small as we like, the ``(\Delta t)^2`` term will be much smaller than the first two terms (remember that the square of a number less than one is much smaller than the number). So, Step 2 is to ignore the ``(\Delta t)^2`` term, in which case
```math
\begin{align}
x(t+\Delta t) &= t^2 + 2 t \Delta t \quad\implies \\
\frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t} &= \frac{[(t^2 + 2 t \Delta t)] - t^2}{\Delta t} \\
&= 2t
\end{align}
```
Hence, 
```math
\frac{dx}{dt} = 2 t .
```
That's all there is to it!

In calculus, there are rules for various basic functions that have been found from the definition. You'll learn these so you don't have to do them from scratch each time.

There is a nice geometric interpretation of the derivative of a function at a point: *it's the slope of the tangent to the function curve at that point*. This follows directly from the definition:
```math
\frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t} = \frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{(t+\Delta t) - t}
```
is just the slope of the line through the points ``(t, x(t))`` and ``(x(t+\Delta t), t+\Delta t)``. This line is called the *secant*. As the point ``(x(t+\Delta t), t+\Delta t)`` gets closer to ``(t, x(t))`` when ``\Delta t \rightarrow 0``, the secant becomes the *tangent*. It's a line that touches the curve at just one point, namely ``(t, x(t))``.

Sometimes a function is too complicated to attempt an exact, analytical solution. We then need an approximate, numerical one.

Imaging that $t$ is discretized into the gridpoints ``(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{i-2}, x_{i-1}, x_i, x_{i+1}, x_{i+2})`` and we want to find an approximation to the derivative at ``x_i``. Based on the definition, we could use
```math
\begin{align}
\frac{dx}{dt} &\approx \frac{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i)}{x_{i+1} - x_i} \quad\text{forward difference} \\
&\approx \frac{f(x_{i}) - f(x_{i-1})}{x_{i} - x_{i-1}} \quad\text{backward difference} \\
&\approx \frac{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1})}{x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}} \quad\text{central difference} \\
\end{align}
```
For reasons we can't go into, the **central difference** is most accurate. Note that in the graphical example above, we used a forward difference.

All of these differences can be made more accurate by **increasing the order** of the approximation, which involves fitting a polynomial to several of the surrounding points and differentiating that exactly. The result is still approximate, but better. Above, the forward and backward formulae are *first-order* while the central is *second-order* accruate.

Writing a function to implement the above formula is not hard. But *a better option is to write no code at all and use a package, which has already been thoroughly debugged and verified.*

Differential equations are central to describing physical phenomena in physics, chemistry, biology, social science, and many other areas.

Remember what they mean: They simply specify how rapidly something (the dependent variable, say population, electric field, etc) is changing when something else (the independent variable, say time, space, etc) changes.

The mathematical goal is to solve the equation for that dependent variable, after specifying initial conditions. We can do this exactly sometimes, but also have nice tools for doing it numerically. The numerical solutions are indeed approximate, but typically very accurate!

We'll be seeing a lot more examples in the coming notebooks, where we'll model many different physical phenomena.
