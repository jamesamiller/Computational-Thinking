# Computational Thinking Course

This material is being developed for a [UAH College of Science](https://www.uah.edu/science) short summer course on **computational thinking** for pre-freshman students. A production version will appear in another repository.

## Motivation

We want to give incoming STEM students

- an introduction into how computation and experiments on a computer can clarify their understanding of difficult concepts such as probability, differential equations,and xxx
- an idea of how modeling can lead to a better understanding of a complex phenomena and lead to predictions of future behavior.
- an introduction to a few important physical and mathematical ideas
- a taste of programming language that will be of use to them during their college career and beyond.

## Inspiration

The MIT course [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/), as taught by Alan Edelman, David Sanders, *et al.* over the past few semesters. 

## Course Design Principles

1. Course divided into *units*, each dealing with a self contained topic of general interest in physics, biology, atmospheric science, and perhaps other STEM areas
2. Prerequisites
    1. High school algebra
    2. No calculus
    3. High school science
2. Synchronous and asynchronous online delivery
4. Computational tool
    1. Julia
    2. Needed language elements introduced in the context of an actual problem. This is not a programming class.
    3. Tentative: given the different platforms students have, we will likely use an online IDE such as [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/lp/)
5. Assignments 
    1. Check understanding of the material and language elements
    2. We will have synchronous online assignment help sessions
