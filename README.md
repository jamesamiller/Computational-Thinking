# Computational Thinking Course

Material for a [UAH College of Science](https://www.uah.edu/science) short summer course on **computational thinking** for pre-freshman science students. The inspiration is the MIT course [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/), as taught by Alan Edelman, David Sanders, *et al.* over the past few semesters.
