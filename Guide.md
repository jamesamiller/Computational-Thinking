## Motivation

We want to give incoming STEM students

- an introduction into how computer experiments can clarify their understanding of difficult concepts, such as probability and statistics and differential equations
- an idea of how modeling can lead to a better understanding of a complex physical phenomena
- an introduction to some important physical and mathematical ideas
- exposure to a programming language that will be of use during their college career and beyond

## Inspiration

The MIT course [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/), as taught by Alan Edelman, David Sanders, *et al.* over the past few semesters. 

## Course Design Principles

1. Course divided into *units*, each dealing with a self contained topic of *general interest* in physics, biology, atmospheric science, and perhaps other STEM areas
2. Units should not be esoteric or filled with jargon
3. Prerequisites
    1. Calculus not required
4. Synchronous and asynchronous online delivery
5. Computational tool
    1. Julia
    2. Language elements introduced in the context of an actual problem 
    3. Not a programming class
    4. Tentative: We will likely use an online IDE such as [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/lp/) for ease of use across platforms
6. Assignments 
    1. Check understanding of the material and language elements
    2. We will have synchronous online assignment help sessions

## Notebook Design Principles

1. Self contained
    1. Text/descriptions need not be exhaustive, since they will be supplemented by instructor commentary
    2. Important background, motivation, and theory should be fairly complete and readable ahead of time
    3. Should include short questions. Answers given during class and added to a "live" version of the notebook
2. A "live" version with instructor commentary and further additions will be worked on during class and posted after
3. A notebook corresponds roughly to a one-hour class
4. Packages should be noted and pre-loaded in Julia
5. Package `using` commands included first in the notebook
